# Password-Generator
Develop a Random password generator

1. basic: This version generates a random password using a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), 
digits, and special characters. You can adjust the length of the password as needed.


3. secrets module: The secrets module provides a more secure way to generate random passwords. 
It ensures that the generated passwords are cryptographically strong.
Remember to adjust the length parameter to your desired password length. 
The second approach using secrets is recommended for applications where security is crucial (e.g., user authentication).
